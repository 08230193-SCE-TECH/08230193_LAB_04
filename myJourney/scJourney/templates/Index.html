        <h2>About My Journey</h2>
        <p>
            My journey in learning ICT began when I first became curious about how computers and websites work. 
            In the beginning, I found programming difficultâ€”especially understanding logic and debugging errors. 
            But through continuous practice, discussions with my classmates, and guidance from my tutors, I started to enjoy coding.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the semesters, I have learned about Python, HTML, CSS, databases, and Django. 
            One of my proudest achievements was developing a project called <strong>Lost Belonging Portal</strong>, 
            which helped me understand how web applications can solve real-life problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            Learning Django has been especially exciting. It allows me to connect data from models to templates using the MVT architecture. 
            Though sometimes challenging, it has taught me patience and problem-solving. 
            I now feel confident in creating simple yet meaningful web applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the future, I want to learn more about full-stack development and build educational tools that can support learning in creative ways.
        </p>
